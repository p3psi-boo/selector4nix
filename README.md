# `selector4nix`

A Nix substituter proxy with parallel cache queries and latency-aware selection.

![Dashboard](./docs/assets/dashboard.png)

## Overview

`selector4nix` sits between your Nix client and multiple upstream substituters, acting as a smart proxy:

- Queries all configured substituters in parallel for `.narinfo` lookups
- Selects the fastest responding substituter based on latency and priority
- Automatically detects and skips unavailable substituters, retrying them with exponential backoff
- Continuously probes substituters to detect failures early and verify recovery
- Proxy private cache substituters with additional credentials
- Pre-fetch multiple NAR file chunks concurrently to improve network utilization, based on sliding window

Note that `selector4nix` only intends to work as a proxy rather than a full-featured cache substituter. NAR files are streamed directly from the best substituter without being cached locally. However, it does cache `.narinfo` files for better responsiveness.

The recommended way to use `selector4nix` is deploying it locally on each host. Since no large NAR file caching is used, `selector4nix` is pretty lightweight in terms of both memory footprint and CPU usage. In contrast, hosting `selector4nix` on a central node in your LAN for other machines doesn't scale well.

## Configuration

### General

`selector4nix` reads a TOML configuration file from the first of these locations:

1. The path specified by the `--config-file` command line argument
2. The path specified by the `SELECTOR4NIX_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable
3. `./selector4nix.toml` in the current directory
4. `/etc/selector4nix/selector4nix.toml`

An example configuration is demonstrated below. For a complete reference of all available fields, see [`docs/configuration.md`](/docs/configuration.md). An annotated example configuration file is also available at [`docs/selector4nix.example.toml`](/docs/selector4nix.example.toml).

```toml
[server]
ip = "127.0.0.1"
# port = 5496 # Default port

[[substituters]]
url = "https://cache.nixos.org/"
# priority = 40 # Default priority

[[substituters]]
url = "https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/nix-channels/store/"
priority = 45 # The higher the value, the lower the priority of this substituter

[[substituters]]
url = "https://selector4nix.cachix.org/"

[[substituters]]
url = "https://cache.garnix.io/"
storage_url = "https://garnix-cache.com/" # Garnix doesn't serve NAR files on https://cache.garnix.io/nar/
```

For NixOS, nix-darwin, and Home Manager users, it is recommended to use the modules provided by this project for declarative setup and configuration.

### Credentials

`selector4nix` can optionally read a TOML credentials file for authenticating with private caches. It is loaded from the first of these locations:

1. The path specified by the `--credential-file` command line argument
2. The path specified by the `SELECTOR4NIX_CREDENTIAL_FILE` environment variable
3. `./credentials.toml` in the current directory
4. `/etc/selector4nix/credentials.toml`

If no credentials file is found, all upstream requests are made without authentication. Credentials are used for `/nix-cache-info` lookups, `.narinfo` queries, and NAR file downloads. This is required for private caches such as [Attic](https://github.com/zhaofengli/attic).

An example credentials file is demonstrated below. For a complete reference, see [`docs/credentials.md`](/docs/credentials.md). An annotated example credentials file is also available at [`docs/credentials.example.toml`](/docs/credentials.example.toml).

```toml
[[credentials]]
url = "https://my.private-cache.com/"
login = "my-username"
secret = "my-secret"
```

### Caching

`selector4nix` can optionally persist query results as cache across restarts. The cache directory must be explicitly specified from one of these locations:

1. The path specified by the `--cache-dir` command line argument
2. The path specified by the `SELECTOR4NIX_CACHE_DIR` environment variable

If neither is provided, an in-memory cache is used and cache is lost on restart.

The cache directory can be safely deleted at any time, though this cause loss of cached query results. Subsequent requests may trigger the fallback strategy, but it may not fully compensate for the missing cache entries.

## Usage

### Ad-hoc

Start the proxy in an ad-hoc style, on whatever OS:

```sh
selector4nix # A configuration file must be discoverable (see Configuration above)
```

On the same machine, point Nix to the proxy, then everything is done. All NAR info queries and subsequent NAR fetching will transparently go through the `selector4nix` proxy.

```sh
nix build --option substituters "http://127.0.0.1:5496/" ...
```

If you care about definite robustness, you can place it before other substituters so it takes priority while keeping fallbacks:

```sh
nix build --option substituters "http://127.0.0.1:5496/ https://cache.nixos.org/" ...
```

### Use the project's own substituter server

The `selector4nix` project has a dedicated [Cachix substituter](https://app.cachix.org/organization/selector4nix/cache/selector4nix). You can optionally add the substituter URL <https://selector4nix.cachix.org/> to your configurations, either the vanilla `nix.settings.substituters` or `selector4nix`'s configuration file itself. Don't forget to add the public key `selector4nix.cachix.org-1:wovVlT07In5JCVz2tFgxPQTLpnN8hZT6P/RwfFcz3KE=`.

Note that `selector4nix.cachix.org` depends on `nix-community.cachix.org` to avoid caching duplicated store paths. It's recommended to also add `nix-community.cachix.org` to your substituter lists to prevent unexpected cache miss.

### Import the NixOS/Nix-darwin/Home Manager Module (flake)

Firstly, the `selector4nix` module should be imported into your system or home configuration, optionally with a Nixpkgs overlay.

On the usage of Nixpkgs overlay, `selector4nix.overlays.default` is exposed and you can configure your system Nixpkgs with the overlay. This is useful when you want to build the `selector4nix` package with the toolchain provided by your system Nixpkgs instance rather than the one defined in the flake output.

For NixOS:

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  inputs.selector4nix.url = "github:StarryReverie/selector4nix";

  outputs = { nixpkgs, selector4nix, ... }@inputs: {
    nixosConfigurations.my-host = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      modules = [
        selector4nix.nixosModules.selector4nix
        # Optional: use the overlay to provide `pkgs.selector4nix`
        # { nixpkgs.overlays = [ selector4nix.overlays.selector4nix ]; }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

For nix-darwin:

```nix
# nix-darwin flake.nix
{
  inputs.selector4nix.url = "github:StarryReverie/selector4nix";

  outputs = { nixpkgs, nix-darwin, selector4nix, ... }@inputs: {
    darwinConfigurations.my-host = nix-darwin.lib.darwinSystem {
      system = "aarch64-darwin";
      modules = [
        selector4nix.darwinModules.selector4nix
        # Optional: use the overlay to provide `pkgs.selector4nix`
        # { nixpkgs.overlays = [ selector4nix.overlays.selector4nix ]; }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

For Home Manager:

```nix
# Home Manager flake.nix
{
  inputs.selector4nix.url = "github:StarryReverie/selector4nix";

  outputs = { nixpkgs, home-manager, selector4nix, ... }@inputs: {
    homeConfigurations.my-user = home-manager.lib.homeManagerConfiguration {
      modules = [
        selector4nix.homeManagerModules.selector4nix
      ];
      # Optional: use the overlay to provide `pkgs.selector4nix`
      # pkgs = import nixpkgs {
      #   system = "x86_64-linux";
      #   overlays = [ selector4nix.overlays.selector4nix ];
      # };
    };
  };
}
```

### Import the NixOS/Nix-darwin/Home Manager Module (niv, npins, etc.)

For those who don't use flakes, a flake-less setup is also possible.

For NixOS:

```nix
# configuration.nix
{ config, ... }:
{
  # Assume that there exists a `selector4nix` input in the lexical scope.
  imports = [ (import "${selector4nix}/nix/modules/nixos.nix" { withSystem = throw "unreachable"; }) ];
  nixpkgs.overlays = [ (import "${selector4nix}/nix/overlay.nix") ];
}
```

For nix-darwin and Home Manager, the setup is similar. The differences are how you import a module and an overlay, and the corresponding module path:

- NixOS: `"${selector4nix}/nix/modules/nixos.nix"`
- nix-darwin: `"${selector4nix}/nix/modules/darwin.nix"`
- Home Manager: `"${selector4nix}/nix/modules/home-manager.nix"`

### Configure the Service

In your NixOS, nix-darwin, or Home Manager configuration:

```nix
# configuration.nix
{ config, ... }:
{
  services.selector4nix = {
    enable = true;

    # This automatically overwrites the substituter list.
    # Alternatives are "keep" (default) and "prepend".
    configureSubstituter = "overwrite";

    # Optional: see Credentials section for detials.
    # credentialFile = "/path/to/my/credentials.toml";

    # Optional: see Caching section for detials.
    # enablePersistentCaching = true;

    settings = {
      substituters = [
        {
          url = "https://cache.nixos.org/";
        }
        {
          url = "https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/nix-channels/store/";
          priority = 45;
        }
        {
          url = "https://nix-community.cachix.org/";
        }
        {
          url = "https://selector4nix.cachix.org/";
        }
        {
          url = "https://cache.garnix.io/";
          storage_url = "https://garnix-cache.com/";
        }
      ];
    };
  };

  nix.settings.trusted-public-keys = [
    "cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY="
    "nix-community.cachix.org-1:mB9FSh9qf2dCimDSUo8Zy7bkq5CX+/rkCWyvRCYg3Fs="
    "selector4nix.cachix.org-1:wovVlT07In5JCVz2tFgxPQTLpnN8hZT6P/RwfFcz3KE="
  ];
}
```

See [Configuration](#configuration) above for details.
